This project is titled "Communication Through Gestures", and runs on the Keras Framework.
The CNN model has been trained to extract 128 features and for 10 epochs.
The Project.ipynb file is a Jupyter Notebook that contains the code for the CNN model.
The gesture_recognition.py file is a Spyder Notebook that contains the UI for the project.
The repository also contains the Project Report for further details and clarifications. 
I'd appreciate any suggestions / improvements from anyone. Also, feel free to contact me in case of any doubts.
